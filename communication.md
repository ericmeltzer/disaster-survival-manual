#Communications and Signaling
Since many normally useful networks become overloaded in the aftermath of a disaster, a good communications kit contains multiple ways to both send and receive messages. After reading the discussion of each method below, you can fill in the Communications section of your plan template. 


###Choosing gear


**Landline**

Local calls may not be possible, but long-distance calls may actually work. Stay on the line until you hear a dial tone, and then call an out-of-state contact to let them know your status. Make sure everyone in your plan knows this contact person and how to reach them.

**Cell Phone**


Cell sites are often located on older buildings which are more in need of the revenue they bring; as a result they are often damaged. The cell sites that escape damage in a disaster then have to cope with an enormous spike in traffic that means voice calling is usually the first thing to go. 


**SMS/Text messages**

The SMS system piggybacks on the "heartbeat" system status updates that cell sites send on a regular basis. They can sometimes get sent out even if your phone shows no signal, and they are relatively unaffected by traffic spikes compared to voice calls. Modern cell networks will  queue texts for delivery in the case of high volume, so you can't rely on the SMS system for timely communication, but it's great for checking in with loved ones or relaying non time-sensitive information. 


**FRS/GMRS Radio**. 

These inexpensive, walkie-talkie-like radios are good for a few city blocks in urban areas or up to several miles in an unobstructed location. Family Radio Service (FRS) does not require a license from the FCC, however General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) radios do. You will often find FRS and GMRS capabilities offered in the same radio handset. 

**MURS radios**

Mark can you flesh this section out?

**Ham Radio, Packet Data.**

Even if you are not a licensed ham, it is perfectly legal to use any radio you want to communicate in an emergency situation. That said, you probably don't want to be using your radio for the first time in your life during a disaster, so it pays to obtain the license. This can be done via a quick and easy test, the answers for which are posted online. While primarily used for voice communications, some ham operators can send email and other files through radios connected to the Internet.
