# Planning and Kits

Writing down a plan and packing a disaster kit are the best things you can do to be ready for a natural disaster. Even the most basic plan and kit will vastly improve your outlook if a disaster occurs: for the seven to ten days it takes for the rescue effort to arrive, you'll be warm, healthy, and full, and therefore able to make good decisions without the distractions that hunger, cold, and injuries bring.


## Mitigate First, Then Plan

Even though we may consider are homes to be refuges, they can be dangerous places. According to the National Safety Council, the five leading causes of deaths in homes include fires and burns, poisoning, falling, airway obstruction, and drowning. Homeowners can take easy steps reduce the possibility of injury or death for each of these risks as well as knowing what to do if something bad happens.

## Fire Mitigation
* *Install, Maintain, and Respond to Smoke Alarms.* Smoke alarms have a life expectancy of 8-10 years. The year of manufacture is stamped on each alarm. If yours is 8-10 years old, replace it. You can optionally install lithium batteries in the new detectors with a life expectancy of 10 years and save money in the long run versus alkaline batteries that should be replaced annually. Remember to regularly push test your alarm to make sure it is functioning, and should you ever hear an unexplained alarm sound, get out and stay out.
* *Pre-position Fire Extinguishers.* All homeowners should have readily accessible type ABC fire extinguisher on each floor of their dwelling, and know how to use it. Remembers the P.A.S.S. system: **P**ull the pin, **A**im the nozzle, **S**queeze the trigger, and **S**weep left and right at the base of the flames. Never try to put out a fire on your own that is larger than the size of an office waste basket.
* *Prepare Escape Routes.* Move obstacles out of areas that may impede escape from  fire. Ideally, each room in your home should have at least two emergency exits. If one of those exits is a window, make sure that the window can be easily opened by all members of your household and, where needed, consider adding an emergency escape ladder that could be hung from the window. Practice using your emergency exits and be sure that everyone knows where to gather following escape, such as a driveway, front yard, or other safe area so you know who is accounted for.

## Poisoning Mitigation
* *Reduce and Secure Household Chemicals*. Numerous household chemicals such as cleaning agents, garden products, solvents, paints, and even cosmetics contain hazardous substances that when inhaled, ingested, or come into contact with the skin or eyes can cause serious harm or death. The best way to mitigate such hazards are to not have such products in the home to begin with. To dispose of such items, contact your local hazardous waste authorities. Necessary but hazardous products should be stored away from children and in spill-proof trays to contain liquids should the containers tip-over in a disaster. Dry hazardous materials should be kept in their original containers inside of a sealed plastic bag. Questions about accidental exposure can be directed to the National Poison Control Center at 800-222-1222. 
* *Install, Test, and Respond to Carbon Monoxide Alarms*. In the United States, about 430 people die per year due to accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. [QuickStats: Average Annual Number of Deaths and Death Rates from Unintentional, Non–Fire-Related Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,*† by Sex and Age Group — United States, 1999–2010] ( http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6303a6.htm) Place carbon monoxide alarms on each level of your dwelling. Note: some smoke alarms come equipped with built-in CO alarms. Carbon monoside is, however, heavier than air and therefore a separate CO alarm should be installed a few inches above the floor. Test the alarms regularly and maintain the batteries.

## Trips, Falls, and Airborne Debris Mitigation
* Inspect Home Stairways, Rugs, Cords, and Other Tripping Hazards.
* Eliminate Slippery Surfaces.
* Anchor Wall and Overhead Furnishings and Fixtures

## Airway Obstructions and Drowning Mitigation
* Purchase N90 Particulate Filter Masks.
* Learn How to Perform Abdominal Thrusts and CPR.

## Making an Emergency Plan

You can't plan for every possible contingency. Emergency managers suggest that you start with *probable* hazards based on your location and occupation.

Consider the most probable types of *natural* disasters: Earthquake, Hurricane, Tornado, Floods, Blizzard, Wild Fire, Landslide, Tsunami

Consider the most probable *man-made or technological* disasters: Radiological/Nuclear, Biological or Chemical Release, Explosion, Civil Disturbance, Dam Failure, Mass Transportation Incident, Long-term Electrical Outage


**Who is in the plan?**

Next, consider who you need to include in your disaster plan.Start with yourself and then geographically expand the plan to include your family, friends, and animals. You must also consider the possible locations of your plan participants when a disaster occurs, such as home, work, school, or elsewhere.

Your plan needs to include any special needs of the plan participants based on age, health status, and mobility.

**How will you communicate with one another?**

Communications is the key to the smooth functioning of a plan. Many of us routinely use electronic communications with plan participant  which may not be available in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Assume that mobile phones, landlines, and internet will not be working. 

Your plan should include an assembly area (your home is the logical primary choice) that people will try to make their way to following a disaster. However, you should also plan an alternate assembly area in case your home is destroyed or unsafe, such as a school, park, or some other location your disaster probability analysis has indicated will likely be outside of the impacted area. If possible, leave a sign at your primary assembly area telling people to meet you at the alternate location.

While restoring communications will be a top priority of emergency personnel following a disaster, their first priority will be communications for disaster responders, government, businesses and lastly the general public. Meanwhile, you need to try to stay abreast of disaster news as best as you can,

**Person to Person and/or Point to Point Communications**

* Landline. Local calls may not be possible, but long-distance calls may actually work. Stay on the line until you hear a dialtone, and then call an out-of-state contact to let them know your status. Make sure everyone in your plan knows this contact person and how to reach them.
* Mobile Phone. Mobile phone towers will be damaged and/or overloaded.
* SMS. If you can get a mobile signal, try sending a SMS message. These messages will enter a queue and will may eventually be delivered hours or even days later.
* FRS/GMRS. These walkie-talkie like radios are goof for short distance communications. FRS does not require a license from the FCC, however GMRS radios do. You will often find FRS and GMRS offered on the same radio handset.
* Amateur Radio, Including Packet Data. The most reliable form of disaster communications is Amateur Radio, also known as "ham" radio. This requires a license from the FCC. While primarily used for voice communications, some ham operators can send email and other files through radios connected to the Internet.


**Listening to Broadcasts**

* AM/FM Radio: have a portable radio with extra batteries
* Television: cable and satellite TV will probably be off-line; however, broadcast TV may be working. A battery-operated TV may be useful. 
* Internet: Your internet service provider will likely be off-line; radio or microwave-based ISPs may still be operational


**Signs and Bulletin Boards**
* Sometimes the best way to communicate with someone may be the old-fashioned way: handwritten messages posted on bulletin boards or areas known by you to be frequented by those you are trying to reach (workplaces, homes, shopping areas, places of worship, etc.)
* Post photos to help identify people you are looking for in case they can't communicate for themselves.
* Date each notice you place and provide information about how to contact you.
