# Planning and Kits

Writing down a plan and packing a disaster kit are the best things you can do to be ready for a natural disaster. Even the most basic plan and kit will vastly improve your outlook if a disaster occurs: for the seven to ten days it takes for the rescue effort to arrive, you'll be warm, healthy, and full, and therefore able to make good decisions without the distractions that hunger, cold, and injuries bring.

Disaster planning provides several distinct advantages:
* it can reduce the fear and anxiety associated with emergencies by providing you with the knowledge, skills, and materials required to respond to disasters
* it lessens the impact of the actual disaster by providing you with the means to meet your immediate physical and emotional needs
* planning, and the resulting self-sufficiency that comes with it, frees emergency responders to address the needs of those most severely impacted by the event
* it enables individuals, families, neighborhoods, and communities to work together to mutually aid one another during the event and post-event recovery process.

While there are many types of different natural and man-made disaster scenarios that could occur, you will find that all of them share common elements that can be addressed with a basic emergency plan.

Elsewhere in this guide we have described the disaster management cycle of mitigation, planning, response, and recovery. In practice, mitigation and planning often go hand-in-hand and may be difficult to distinguish from one another. For example, part of making a home disaster plan is to thoroughly inspect your house or apartment for hazards and to make changes (frequently do-it-yourself projects) to eliminate or lessen the hazard.

## Reducing Hazards

Even though we may consider are homes to be refuges,they can be dangerous places. According to the National Safety Council, the five leading causes of deaths in homes include fires and burns, poisoning, falling, airway obstruction, and drowning. There are easy steps homeowners can take to reduce the possibility of injury or death for each of these as well as knowing what to do if something bad happens.


## Fire Hazards

Most of us learned basic fire safety in elementary school:
* never use flammable liquids indoors
* store flammable liquids in approved containers and in well-ventilated areas
* never smoke near flammable liquids or in bed
* safely discard rags and other materials soaked in flammable liquids
* ensure that your chimneys are properly insulated and maintained
* keep fireplaces screened and store ashes in a metal container
* keep space heaters at least three feet away from flammable materials such as bedding, draperies, and furniture
* don't overload electrical circuits


Now imagine that you are an inspector for the fire department. Your job is to identify every possible hazard that you can in your home. 
*What to you see?*

* Flammable liquids such as cooking oils, hairspray, nail polish remover, and oil paints?
* A fireplace and no one at home remembers when it was last inspected?
* A space heater that's stuck away under a desk right next to a wastebasket?
* Two power strips, one plugged into the other, with a wire running underneath a throw rug?


The implications are clear. Most homes will fail in at least one of these areas. While we may not be able to avoid the use of all flammable liquids in our homes, we can be mindful about where we store and use them. We can have our fireplaces inspected and exercise reasonable caution when using them. Space heaters can be better positioned, and electrical outlets and extensions cords used safely (check the packaging).
