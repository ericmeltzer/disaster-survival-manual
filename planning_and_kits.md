# Planning and Kits

Writing down a plan and packing a disaster kit are the best things you can do to be ready for a natural disaster. Even the most basic plan and kit will vastly improve your outlook if a disaster occurs: for the three to five days it takes for the rescue effort to arrive, you'll be warm, healthy, and full, and therefore able to make good decisions without the distractions that hunger, cold, and injuries bring.
