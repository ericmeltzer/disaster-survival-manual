# Planning and Kits

Writing down a plan and packing a disaster kit are the best things you can do to be ready for a natural disaster. Even the most basic plan and kit will vastly improve your outlook if a disaster occurs: for the seven to ten days it takes for the rescue effort to arrive, you'll be warm, healthy, and full, and therefore able to make good decisions without the distractions that hunger, cold, and injuries bring.


## Mitigate First, Then Plan

Even though we may consider are homes to be refuges, they can be dangerous places. According to the National Safety Council, the five leading causes of deaths in homes include fires and burns, poisoning, falling, airway obstruction, and drowning. There are easy steps homeowners can take to reduce the possibility of injury or death for each of these as well as knowing what to do if something bad happens.

## Fires
* Install, Maintain, and Respond to Smoke Alarms
* Putting Out a Fire
* Escape and Reunion

## Poisoning
* Household Chemicals
* Carbon Monoxide

## Trips, Falls, and Airborne Debris
* Stairways, Rugs, Cords, and Other Tripping Hazards
* Water, Slippery Surfaces
* Wall and Overhead Furnishings and Fixtures

## Airway Obstructions and Drowning
* Airborne Hazards
* Floods

## Making an Emergency Plan

You can't plan for every possible contingency. Emergency managers suggest that you start with *probable* hazards based on your location and occupation.

Consider the most probable types of *natural* disasters: Earthquake, Hurricane, Tornado, Floods, Blizzard, Wild Fire, Landslide, Tsunami

Consider the most probable *man-made or technological* disasters: Radiological/Nuclear, Biological or Chemical Release, Explosion, Civil Disturbance, Dam Failure, Mass Transportation Incident, Long-term Electrical Outage


**Who is in the plan?**

Next, consider who you need to include in your disaster plan.Start with yourself and then geographically expand the plan to include your family, friends, and animals. You must also consider the possible locations of your plan participants when a disaster occurs, such as home, work, school, or elsewhere.

Your plan needs to include any special needs of the plan participants based on age, health status, and mobility.

**How will you communicate with one another?**

Communications is the key to the smooth functioning of a plan. Many of us routinely use electronic communications with plan participant  which may not be available in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Assume that mobile phones, landlines, and internet will not be working. 

Your plan should include an assembly area (your home is the logical primary choice) that people will try to make their way to following a disaster. However, you should also plan an alternate assembly area in case your home is destroyed or unsafe, such as a school, park, or some other location your disaster probability analysis has indicated will likely be outside of the impacted area. If possible, leave a sign at your primary assembly area telling people to meet you at the alternate location.

While restoring communications will be a top priority of emergency personnel following a disaster, their first priority will be communications for disaster responders, government, businesses and lastly the general public. Meanwhile, you need to try to stay abreast of disaster news as best as you can,

**Person to Person and/or Point to Point Communications**

* Landline. Local calls may not be possible, but long-distance calls may actually work. Stay on the line until you hear a dialtone, and then call an out-of-state contact to let them know your status. Make sure everyone in your plan knows this contact person and how to reach them.
* Mobile Phone. Mobile phone towers will be damaged and/or overloaded.
* SMS. If you can get a mobile signal, try sending a SMS message. These messages will enter a queue and will may eventually be delivered hours or even days later.
* FRS/GMRS. These walkie-talkie like radios are goof for short distance communications. FRS does not require a license from the FCC, however GMRS radios do. You will often find FRS and GMRS offered on the same radio handset.
* Amateur Radio, Including Packet Data. The most reliable form of disaster communications is Amateur Radio, also known as "ham" radio. This requires a license from the FCC. While primarily used for voice communications, some ham operators can send email and other files through radios connected to the Internet.


**Listening to Broadcasts**

* AM/FM Radio: have a portable radio with extra batteries
* Television: cable and satellite TV will probably be off-line; however, broadcast TV may be working. A battery-operated TV may be useful. 
* Internet: Your internet service provider will likely be off-line; radio or microwave-based ISPs may still be operational


**Signs and Bulletin Boards**
* Sometimes the best way to communicate with someone may be the old-fashioned way: handwritten messages posted on bulletin boards or areas known by you to be frequented by those you are trying to reach (workplaces, homes, shopping areas, places of worship, etc.)
* Post photos to help identify people you are looking for in case they can't communicate for themselves.
* Date each notice you place and provide information about how to contact you.

# Making the Plan-Kit Connection

## Where should I keep my kit?
* Home
* Work
* Auto

## What should be in my kit?
**Basic Needs: Water, Food, Air, Shelter, Sleep, Sanitation

**Water**
* 1 gallon (4 liters) per person per day. 
* Plan for at least 7 days
* More in hot weather, lactating women, or those who are ill
* Never ration water; find more (check hot water tank, toilet tank, freezer, water pipes)
* Purify your own water:


**Food**

* 1500 calories per person per day
* Protein, carbohydrates, fats
* Mass care feeding programs

**Air**
* Hazardous chemicals and particulates
* Biological threats
* Odors

**Shelter**
* Air Temperature
* Precipitation
* Sun exposure
* Privacy
* Sleep

Vehicles, tents, tarps
Mass care shelters


**Sanitation**
* Skin, Hair, Mouth
* Urine and Feces
* Other Waste Products

**Safety Needs:** 
* Personal Security
* Property and Resources (Financial Kits)
