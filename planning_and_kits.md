# Planning and Kits

Writing down a plan and packing a disaster kit are the best things you can do to be ready for a natural disaster. Even the most basic plan and kit will vastly improve your outlook if a disaster occurs: for the seven to ten days it takes for the rescue effort to arrive, you'll be warm, healthy, and full, and therefore able to make good decisions without the distractions that hunger, cold, and injuries bring.

## Mitigate First, Then Plan

Even though we may consider are homes to be refuges, they can be dangerous places. According to the National Safety Council, the five leading causes of deaths in homes include fires and burns, poisoning, falling, airway obstruction, and drowning. Homeowners can take easy steps reduce the possibility of injury or death for each of these risks as well as knowing what to do if something bad happens.

## Fire Mitigation
* *Install, Maintain, and Respond to Smoke Alarms.* Smoke alarms have a life expectancy of 8-10 years. The year of manufacture is stamped on each alarm. If yours is 8-10 years old, replace it. You can optionally install lithium batteries in the new detectors with a life expectancy of 10 years and save money in the long run versus alkaline batteries that should be replaced annually. Remember to regularly push test your alarm to make sure it is functioning, and should you ever hear an unexplained alarm sound, get out and stay out.
* *Pre-position Fire Extinguishers.* All homeowners should have readily accessible type ABC fire extinguisher on each floor of their dwelling, and know how to use it. Remembers the P.A.S.S. system: **P**ull the pin, **A**im the nozzle, **S**queeze the trigger, and **S**weep left and right at the base of the flames. Never try to put out a fire on your own that is larger than the size of an office waste basket.
* *Prepare Escape Routes.* Move obstacles out of areas that may impede escape from  fire. Ideally, each room in your home should have at least two emergency exits. If one of those exits is a window, make sure that the window can be easily opened by all members of your household and, where needed, consider adding an emergency escape ladder that could be hung from the window. Practice using your emergency exits and be sure that everyone knows where to gather following escape, such as a driveway, front yard, or other safe area so you know who is accounted for.

## Poisoning Mitigation
* *Reduce and Secure Household Chemicals*. Numerous household chemicals such as cleaning agents, garden products, solvents, paints, and even cosmetics contain hazardous substances that when inhaled, ingested, or come into contact with the skin or eyes can cause serious harm or death. The best way to mitigate such hazards are to not have such products in the home to begin with. To dispose of such items, contact your local hazardous waste authorities. Necessary but hazardous products should be stored away from children and in spill-proof trays to contain liquids should the containers tip-over in a disaster. Dry hazardous materials should be kept in their original containers inside of a sealed plastic bag. Questions about accidental exposure can be directed to the National Poison Control Center at 800-222-1222. 
* *Install, Test, and Respond to Carbon Monoxide Alarms*. In the United States, about 430 people die per year due to accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. [QuickStats: Average Annual Number of Deaths and Death Rates from Unintentional, Non–Fire-Related Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,*† by Sex and Age Group — United States, 1999–2010] ( http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6303a6.htm) Place carbon monoxide alarms on each level of your dwelling. Note: some smoke alarms come equipped with built-in CO alarms. Carbon monoside is, however, heavier than air and therefore a separate CO alarm should be installed a few inches above the floor. Test the alarms regularly and maintain the batteries.

## Trips, Falls, and Airborne Debris Mitigation
* Inspect Home Stairways, Rugs, Cords, and Other Tripping Hazards.
* Eliminate Slippery Surfaces.
* Anchor Wall and Overhead Furnishings and Fixtures

## Airway Obstructions and Drowning Mitigation

* *Purchase N95 Particulate Filter Masks.* In disaster scenarios, airway obstructions may result from the inhalation of toxic materials which constrict airways and make it difficult to breath normally. To prevent many such toxins from entering through your nose or mouth use filter masks rated N95 or higher. If your masks are not immediately available, cover your mouth and nose with a clean cloth and breath slowly through your nose (which has more natural filtering capabilities than your mouth).
* *Learn How to Perform Abdominal Thrusts and CPR.* Abdominal thrusts (previously referred to as the Heimlich Maneuver) can help people expel an object that may be lodged in their throat preventing air from entering their lungs. Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is follows a simple ABC method for  means checking a victim's **A**irway for obstructions, checking their **B**reathing, and restoring **C**irculation by squeezing a victims heart between their ribcage and backbone, thereby pumping blood to vital organs after the heart has stopped beating. The skills for administering Abdominal Thrusts and CPR are often taught in the same classes, available from many organizations including the [American Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/) and the [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/). If your household contains children, be sure to get training pertinent to their age group(s).

## Power Outage Mitigation
* *Batteries.* For many households the primary source of alternate power is batteries. Indeed, many of our small electronic devices primarily run on batteries which are either replaced or recharged as needed. But large appliances need household current to operate,and an extra set of AA or AAA batteries won't help. Businesses sometimes have very large battery systems that are designed to keep vital systems running, usually until such time as an alternate source of power (such as a generator, below) becomes operational. Critical medical systems (such as breathing apparatuses and IV therapy) which are dependent on household power often have built-in batteries to enable them to continue to operate for a short period of time. External batteries in the form of Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) may be used to supplement on-board batteries but will themselves fail over time.
* *Generating Power.* Power outages that last more than a few days could jeopardize the health and well-being of those dependent on certain medical devices. Depending upon the local weather conditions homes may become dangerously hot or cold. Refrigerated food supplies may spoil and cook stoves unusable. If your reply on well water your pump will not be working. Communications will be impaired. For reasons such as these you may wish to consider alternate means of generating all or a portion of the electricity your household requires. Look into portable generators, solar and wind power to determine if their use is feasible for your household situation.
* *Lighting.* No matter your particular power situation, human beings need light to operate safely at night. Be sure to lay-in a supply of flashlights (and extra batteries), hand-crank lighting, camp lanterns (with extra fuel), and other means of illumination from personal lights to large area lights.

## Making an Emergency Plan

You can't plan for every possible contingency. Emergency managers suggest that you start with *probable* hazards based on your location and occupation.

**Natural and Manmade/Technologial Disasters.** Consider the most probable types of *natural* disasters: earthquake, hurricane, tornado, floods, blizzard, wild fire, landslide, tsunami, and the the most probable *man-made or technological* disasters: radiological/nuclear, biological or chemical release, explosion, civil disturbance, dam failure, mass transportation incident, long-term electrical outage.

**Who Is in The Plan?**
Next, consider who you need to include in your disaster plan. Start with yourself and then geographically expand the plan to include your family, friends, and animals. You must also**** consider the possible locations of your plan participants when a disaster occurs, such as home, work, school, or elsewhere.

Your plan needs to include any special needs of the plan participants based on age, health status, and mobility.

**Emergency Communications.** Communications is the key to the smooth functioning of a plan. Many of us routinely use electronic communications with plan participant  which may not be available in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Assume that mobile phones, landlines, and internet will *not* be working. 

Your plan should include an assembly area (your home is the logical primary choice) that people will try to make their way to following a disaster. However, you should also plan an alternate assembly area in case your home is destroyed or unsafe, such as a school, park, or some other location your disaster probability analysis has indicated will likely be outside of the impacted area. If possible, leave a sign at your primary assembly area telling people to meet you at the alternate location.

While restoring communications will be a top priority of emergency personnel following a disaster, their first priority will be communications for disaster responders, government, businesses and lastly the general public. Meanwhile, you need to try to stay abreast of disaster news as best as you can,

**Personal Electronic Communications**

* *Landline*. Local calls may not be possible, but long-distance calls may actually work. Stay on the line until you hear a dialtone, and then call an out-of-state contact to let them know your status. Make sure everyone in your plan knows this contact person and how to reach them.
* *Mobile Phone*. Mobile phone towers will be damaged and/or overloaded.
* *SMS*. If you can get a mobile signal, try sending a SMS message. These messages will enter a queue and will may eventually be delivered hours or even days later.
* *FRS/GMRS Radio*. These inexpensive, walkie-talkie-like radios are good for short distance communications, a few city blocks, up to several miles in an unobstructed location. Family Radio Service (FRS) does not require a license from the FCC, however General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) radios do. You will often find FRS and GMRS capabilities offered in the same radio handset.
* *Amateur Radio, Including Packet Data.* The most reliable form of disaster communications is Amateur Radio, also known as "ham" radio. This requires a license from the FCC. While primarily used for voice communications, some ham operators can send email and other files through radios connected to the Internet.

**Broadcast Communications**

* *AM/FM Radio.* have a portable radio with extra batteries
* *Television.* cable and satellite TV will probably be off-line; however, broadcast television stations often disaster resistant broadcast capabilities. Since power may be out, a battery-operated TV may be useful. 
* *Internet.* Your internet service provider will likely be off-line; radio or microwave-based ISPs may still be operational


**Signs and Bulletin Boards**
* Sometimes the best way to communicate with someone may be the old-fashioned way: handwritten messages posted on bulletin boards or areas known by you to be frequented by those you are trying to reach (workplaces, homes, shopping areas, places of worship, etc.)
* Post photos to help identify people you are looking for in case they can't communicate for themselves.
* Date each notice you place and provide information about how to contact you.

# Making the Plan-Kit Connection
Your emergency plan informs what you need in and where you locate your emergency kits. Yes, that is kits, plural, because you never know where you might be when disaster strikes and unless you plan to have your kit in a backpack, and our backpack always with you, your will need more than one.

## Kit L**ocations?
* Home**. This is your primary kit, meant to support you and other members of your household, for up to 7 days. (Other authorities will suggest 3 days of emergency supplies. Experience following major disaster such as hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, blizzards in New England, and other events suggests that it may take up to a week for significant emergency resources to reach an area. More and more Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) are now recommending one week of supplies.)
* *Work*. The contents of work kit depends upon the emergency plans of your workplace. Some businesses have robust emergency plans including "arks" brimming with emergency supplies, employees trained in first aid, search and rescue, and radio communications. Your employer may be prepared to support its employees for several days if necessary. (Many schools have such plans, so if you have school-age children they will be taken care of.) Small businesses may have nothing more than a first aid kit. Inquire about your workplace plans. At the very least, be sure you have a supply of any prescription medications you may need to take and a backpack that could support you should you need to walk home.
* *Vehicle*. Many people own a vehicle. If you use your vehicle to get to work and park it in an area unlikely to be affected by a disaster, you may decide to combine your work kit and vehicle kit. However, our vehicles often transport more than just one person, so its prudent to have supplies in a vehicle kit to support yourself and several passengers. Keep your kit in the trunk or under a blanket or tarp to conceal it from would-be thieves.

## What should be in my kit?
This is the most basic of questions. Our answer begins with the most basic of needs: water, food, air, shelter, sleep, and sanitation.

**Water**
* 1 gallon (4 liters) per person per day, for 7 days
* More water in hot weather, lactating women, or those who are ill
* Never ration water; find more (check hot water tank, toilet tank, freezer, water pipes)
* Purify your own water: see the information from the  [Centers for Disease Control](http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/emergency_disinfection.html).

**Food**

* 2500 calories per person per day (may be slightly more or less based on metabolic rate, activity, and age)
* Include items you know people will eat (test-drive your survival foods) and exclude items that are known allergens for those in your household
* If you are using dehydrated foods, increase water supplies accordingly
* If you have foods that need to be cooked, be sure to include the necessary utensils and cooking devices
* Plan for disposal of food scraps and food packaging
* Be alert for announcements of mass care feeding programs such as those offered by the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army following disasters

**Air**
* Assume that local air may contain hazardous chemicals,  particulates, or biological pathogens; have filter masks for everyone in your household
* Disasters stink, literally and figuratively. Be prepared for unpleasant odors by having a jar of Vicks® VapoRub™, mint oil,  or another aromatic to dab beneath your nose.

**Shelter**
*  If you are unable to stay in your home you will need to find shelter. Friends, family, hotels, and so on may not be able to ttake you in. So unless disaster befalls you on a tropical island, you will likely need protection from immoderate temperatures, precipitation, sun exposure, insects, and wild animals.
* Privacy.
* Sleep
* Lighting

Vehicles, tents, tarps
Mass care shelters

**Sanitation**
* Skin, Hair, Mouth
* Urine and Feces
* Other Waste Products

**Safety Needs:** 
* Personal Security
* Property and Resources (Financial Kits)
