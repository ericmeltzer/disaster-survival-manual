# Planning and Kits

Even the most basic plan and kit will vastly improve your outlook if a disaster occurs: for the five to seven days it takes for the rescue effort to arrive, you'll be warm, healthy, and full, and therefore able to make good decisions without the distractions that hunger, cold, and injuries bring.

## Mitigate existing hazards

**INSTALL AND MAINTAIN SMOKE/CARBON MONOXIDE ALARMS**

Look for alarms that detect carbon monoxide as well as smoke, and ideally alarms that use both photoelectric and ionization methods of detection. Smoke alarms have a life expectancy of 8-10 years. The year of manufacture is stamped on each alarm. If yours is 8-10 years old, replace it. You can optionally install lithium batteries in the new detectors with a life expectancy of 10 years and save money in the long run versus alkaline batteries that should be replaced annually. Legal requirements vary by state, but one alarm per bedroom, one outside every bedroom, and at least one per floor of your house including basements is a good starting point. It takes a surprisingly long time for a smoke alarm to go off if the source isn't in the same room as the alarm, so more alarms are always a good investment. Remember to regularly push test your alarm to make sure it is functioning, and should you ever hear an unexplained alarm sound, get out and stay out.

**PRE-POSITION FIRE EXTINGUISHERS**

You should have a readily accessible type ABC fire extinguisher on each floor of their dwelling, and know how to use it. Remembers the P.A.S.S. system: **P**ull the pin, **A**im the nozzle, **S**queeze the trigger, and **S**weep left and right at the _base_ of the flames. Never try to put out a fire on your own that is larger than the size of an office waste basket; instead, escape. Extinguishers expire—check to make sure yours are current now.

**PREPARE ESCAPE ROUTES**

Move obstacles out of areas that may impede escape from fire, and ensure there are no slippery surfaces or tripping hazards like cords in your exit route. Ideally, each room in your home should have at least two emergency exits. If one of those exits is a window, make sure that the window can be easily opened by all members of your household. For windows on the 2nd story or above, add emergency escape ladders that can be hung from the window. Practice using your emergency exits and agree upon a single safe gathering point such as a driveway, front yard, or other safe area so you can easily see if anyone is missing.

## Make an Plan

**DECIDE WHAT TO PLAN FOR**

Consider the most probable types of natural as well as man-made disasters for your area, which may include:

* Earthquake
* Hurricane
* Tornado
* Flooding
* Blizzard
* Wildfire
* Landslide
* Tsunami
* Nuclear, Biological or Chemical release
* Explosion
* Civil disturbance
* Dam failure
* Mass transportation incident
* Long term electrical outage

**DECIDE WHO TO INCLUDE**

Start with yourself and then expand the plan to include your family, friends, and animals. Consider the possible locations of your plan participants when a disaster occurs, such as home, work, school, or elsewhere.

Your plan needs to include any special needs of the plan participants based on age, health status, and mobility. Non-English speakers should have a phrase book or smartphone app to assist with communications.

**DECIDE WHERE TO MEET UP**

Choose an assembly area \(your home is the logical primary choice\) that people will make their way to following a disaster, and an alternate assembly area in case your home is destroyed or unsafe. A good alternate assembly area choice is a school, park, or other location that is far enough from your primary choice to be unaffected by whatever made the primary choice unsafe, but close enough that you can walk there from the primary. Plan to leave a sign \(using a paint pen, or other permanent marking method\) at your primary assembly area telling people to meet you at the alternate location if that becomes necessary.

**DECIDE HOW YOU WILL COMMUNICATE**

_Landline_. Local calls may not be possible, but long-distance calls may actually work. Stay on the line until you hear a dialtone, and then call an out-of-state contact to let them know your status. Make sure everyone in your plan knows this contact person and how to reach them.

* _Mobile Phone_. Mobile phone towers will be damaged and/or overloaded.
* _SMS_. If you can get a mobile signal, try sending a SMS message. These messages will enter a queue and will may eventually be delivered hours or even days later.
* _FRS/GMRS Radio_. These inexpensive, walkie-talkie-like radios are good for short distance communications, a few city blocks, up to several miles in an unobstructed location. Family Radio Service \(FRS\) does not require a license from the FCC, however General Mobile Radio Service \(GMRS\) radios do. You will often find FRS and GMRS capabilities offered in the same radio handset.
* _Amateur Radio, Including Packet Data._ The most reliable form of disaster communications is Amateur Radio, also known as "ham" radio. This requires a license from the FCC. While primarily used for voice communications, some ham operators can send email and other files through radios connected to the Internet.

# Step 3. Assemble a Kit

Your emergency plan informs what you need in and where to put your emergency kits. Yes, that is kits, plural, because you never know where you might be when disaster strikes. However, if you can't afford to buy more than one kit, we suggest you keep your single kit in the trunk of your car if you  have one, since it's likely to be near you most of the time.

### What should be in my kit?

**Water**

* 1 gallon \(4 liters\) per person per day, for 7 days
* More water in hot weather, lactating women, or those who are ill
* Never ration water; find more \(check hot water tank, toilet tank, freezer, water pipes\)
* Purify your own water: see the information from the  [Centers for Disease Control](http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/emergency_disinfection.html).

**Food**

* 2500 calories per person per day \(may be slightly more or less based on metabolic rate, activity, and age\)
* Include items you know people will eat \(test-drive your survival foods\) and exclude items that are known allergens for those in your household
* If you are using dehydrated foods, increase water supplies accordingly
* If you have foods that need to be cooked, be sure to include the necessary utensils and cooking devices
* Plan for disposal of food scraps and food packaging
* Be alert for announcements of mass care feeding programs such as those offered by the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army following disasters

**Air**

* Assume that local air may contain hazardous chemicals,  particulates, or biological pathogens; have filter masks for everyone in your household
* Disasters stink, literally and figuratively. Be prepared for unpleasant odors by having a jar of Vicks® VapoRub™, mint oil,  or another aromatic to dab beneath your nose.

**Shelter**

* If you are unable to stay in your home you will need to find shelter. Friends, family, hotels, and so on may not be able to ttake you in. So unless disaster befalls you on a tropical island, you will likely need protection from immoderate temperatures, precipitation, sun exposure, insects, and wild animals. If you have a vehicle, that's a good place to start. Tents and other portable shelters may be needed to accommodate larger groups. 
* Following a disaster, many people experience a profound loss of privacy which can impact their psychological and physical well-being. Arranging for even the most elementary privacy in the form of a temporary blanket barrier may help people better cope with their situation.
* Sleep deprivation can have serious consequences for your judgment, reaction time, and other skills needed to keep you safe. Be sure to get your sleep whenever and wherever you can.

**Vision**

* If you can't see you are significantly handicapped during an emergency. Be sure to include emergency lighting \(flashlights, lanterns, candles\).
* Likewise, include back-up prescription eyewear, safety goggles \(to protect your eyes from airborne particulates\), sunglasses, and eye drops to hydrate or flush foreign particles from your eyes.
* A magnifying glass may be useful in helping you remove small splinters and can also be used to start a fire.

**Sanitation**

* Your skin and hair may become very dirty and smelly. Place some large, moistened sanitary wipes in your kit for a quick wipedown.
* Pack a toothbrush and toothpaste to try to maintain oral hygiene.
* People will continue to poop and pee, so you will want to be ready with tome toilet paper and/or sanitary wipes. You can turn a five gallon pail into a temporary toilet, and bury human waste as necessary. Children in diapers and adults with incontinence or ostomy products need to have their supplies included in your kit.
* Other organic waste products, such as spoiled food and pet waste also need to be accounted for. Remember, normal sanitation services \(sewer, running water, trash services\) may not be available for some time. Plan accordingly.

**First Aid**

Please see the section in this manual on First Aid.

**Personal Security**

* Your best bet for personal security is to try to get to a place where law enforcement or the military is visible, in control, and able to provide for the safety of civilians.
* Always travel with at least one other person, especially at night and in unsecured surroundings.
* Listen to your senses. If you feel unsafe or unsure of something or somebody, leave.
* Those who are properly trained and licensed may elect to carry a weapon but be aware that this can actually increase your security risk.\*\*

**Finances and Identification**

Natural and man-made disasters always have a significant financial impact on the inhabitants and businesses of the affected areas. If you lose your home, you may also lose access to the documents needed to help in your financial recovery. It is important to include financial information and proof of identity in your kit and/or have copies of documents that will be accessible to you during the recovery phase of the disaster.

_Important documents_

* photo identification \(driver's license, state IDs, passports\)
* social security cards
* medical insurance cards
* lists of current medical conditions, prescription medications, and doctors
* homeowners, renters, vehicle insurance information
* life insurance information
* deeds, wills, birth certificates, advanced medical directives
* photos of household contents, including garage and yard items, vehicles
* Broadcast Communications

* _AM/FM Radio._ have a portable radio with extra batteries

* _Television._ cable and satellite TV will probably be off-line; however, broadcast television stations often disaster resistant broadcast capabilities. Since power may be out, a battery-operated TV may be useful. 
* _Internet._ Your internet service provider will likely be off-line; radio or microwave-based ISPs may still be operational

### Signs and Bulletin Boards

* Handwritten messages posted on bulletin boards or areas known by you to be frequented by those you are trying to reach \(workplaces, homes, shopping areas, places of worship, etc\) are a great way to communicate. 
* Keep 10-20 photos or pre-printed MISSING PERSON signs for each family member in your planning kit, for easy posting if it becomes necessary.
* Make sure to date each notice you place and provide information about how to contact you.

_Cash._ Include cash in your kit. How much is up to you, but be aware that banks and other financial institutions may not be able open for some time, ATM machines may be nun-functional, and credit/debit cards transactions unavailable. Cash may be the only option available to you for purchasing needed items. Businesses that are open may not accept large denomination bills if they are short on cash themselves.

_Alternative Documents Storage._ If you are worried about keeping documents in your kit consider placing digitally encrypted copies online.You can also encrypt copies and put them on USB drive in your kit. If you are uncomfortable with any sort of digital storage of files, make paper copies and place them in the custody of a trusted relative or friend, preferably outside of your immediate area.

### Home

This is your primary kit, meant to support you and other members of your household, for up to 7 days. \(Other authorities will suggest 3 days of emergency supplies. Experience following major disaster such as hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, blizzards in New England, and other events suggests that it may take up to a week for significant emergency resources to reach an area. More and more Community Emergency Response Teams \(CERT\) are now recommending one week of supplies.\)

### Work

The contents of work kit depends upon the emergency plans of your workplace. Some businesses have robust emergency plans including "arks" brimming with emergency supplies, employees trained in first aid, search and rescue, and radio communications. Your employer may be prepared to support its employees for several days if necessary. \(Many schools have such plans, so if you have school-age children they will be taken care of.\) Small businesses may have nothing more than a first aid kit. Inquire about your workplace plans. At the very least, be sure you have a supply of any prescription medications you may need to take and a backpack that could support you should you need to walk home.

### Vehicle

Many people own a vehicle. If you use your vehicle to get to work and park it in an area unlikely to be affected by a disaster, you may decide to combine your work kit and vehicle kit. However, our vehicles often transport more than just one person, so its prudent to have supplies in a vehicle kit to support yourself and several passengers. Keep your kit in the trunk or under a blanket or tarp to conceal it from would-be thieves.
