# Earthquake Safety

## Preparing for an Earthquake
### Earthquake-proofing Your House
Secure the top of furniture that can tip over, such as book shelves, dressers, wall cabinets, and armoires. Furniture often comes with braces or wall straps for this purpose, but you can also buy these separately. Make sure you find and screw into a wall stud when you attach the brace or wall strap.

Anything that hangs on a wall can fall even in a small earthquake. To prevent this, hang picture frames and objects using picture wire and "maze hooks". You should still avoid hanging anything over your bed that could fall on you while you sleep.

Earthquakes can cause items inside cabinets to move around, pushing the cabinet door to open, and fall out. Consider installing push-latches on cabinet doors to prevent this. Make sure heavy objects such as books, and hazardous items such as household chemicals, cannot fall or spill in an earthquake.

Secure any important loose items in your home. You can use "quake putty", a reusable putty adhesive, to hold objects down, so they don't fall during an earthquake. You may want to do this with expensive items such as antiques and electronics.



## During an Earthquake

### Stay Inside or Go Outside
Generally, you will be safer staying inside a building than going outside. If you are in a developed country, where building codes are stricter, buildings are unlikely to collapse. If you are outside, fixtures, window glass, and bricks falling off of buildings are a greater threat.

Statistically, you are still safer inside even if you are in areas where building codes are inadequate. Most buildings do not collapse. If you are outside, you are in as much danger from rubble falling from a nearby building that does collapse.

There is no single rule that will guarantee your safety in a large earthquake. If you know your building is not sound, you should try to get out. But know that when you are outside, nearby buildings and structures pose a great danger too.
