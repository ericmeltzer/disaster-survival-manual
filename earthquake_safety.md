# Earthquake Safety

-talke about earthquake proofing a house


### Stay Inside or Go Outside
Generally, you will be safer staying inside a building than going outside. If you are in a developed country, where building codes are stricter, buildings are unlikely to collapse. If you are outside, fixtures, window glass, and bricks falling off of buildings are a greater threat.

Statistically, you are still safer inside even if you are in areas where building codes are inadequate. Most buildings do not collapse. If you are outside, you are in as much danger from rubble falling from a nearby building that does collapse.

There is no single rule that will guarantee your safety in a large earthquake. If you know your building is not sound, you should try to get out. But know that when you are outside, nearby buildings and structures pose a great danger too.
