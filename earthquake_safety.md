# Earthquake Safety

-talke about earthquake proofing a house

You will be safer staying inside a building than going outside. If you are in a developed country, where building codes are stricter, buildings are unlikely to collapse. Fixtures, window glass, and bricks falling off the outside of buildings can injure you if you are outside.

Statistically, you are still safer inside even if you are in areas where building codes are inadequate. When you are outside, you are in as much danger from rubble if you are near a building that does collapse.

There is no single thing to do that will keep you safe in a large earthquake. If you know your building is not sound, you should try to get out, but know that nearby buildings or structures pose a great danger too.
