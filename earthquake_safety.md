# Earthquake Safety

## Preparing for an Earthquake
### Earthquake-proofing Your House
Secure the top of furniture that can tip over, such as book shelves, dressers, wall cabinets, and armoires. Furniture often comes with braces or wall straps for this purpose, but you can also buy these separately. Make sure you find and screw into a wall stud when you attach the brace or wall strap.

Anything that hangs on a wall can fall even in a small earthquake. To prevent this, hang picture frames and objects using picture wire and "maze hooks". You should still avoid hanging anything over your bed that could fall on you while you sleep.

Earthquakes can cause items inside cabinets to move around, pushing the cabinet door to open, and fall out. Consider installing push-latches on cabinet doors to prevent this. You may want to further strap down heavy objects such as books, and hazardous items such as household chemicals.

Secure any important loose items in your home. You can use "quake putty", a reusable putty adhesive, to hold objects down, so they don't fall during an earthquake. You may want to do this with expensive items such as antiques and electronics.



## During an Earthquake
###Drop, Cover, Hold on
If you are inside, as soon as you sense shaking, **drop** down to the ground on your hands and knees. **Cover** your head and neck with your hand. Find a sturdy piece of furniture, such as a desk or table, and crawl under it and **hold** on. Furniture can move in a big earthquake, prepare to move with it so your body remains covered.

The biggest danger is from falling or flying objects, which is why under furniture is the safest place to be. Even in the unlikely scenario of a building collapse, a sturdy desk or table can preserve the space under it. If you cannot find something to get under, crouch next to something sturdy, such as an interior wall. Remain on your hands and knees to protect your vital organs, and keep your head covered. 

If you are in bed when an earthquake starts, stay in bed, and cover your head with a pillow.

Contrary to popular belief, do **not** crouch next to furniture and do **not** stand inside a doorway. These actions do not protect you from the biggest source of injury: falling and flying objects.

### Stay Inside
Do not run outside. Generally, you will be safer staying inside a building than going outside. If you are in a developed country, where building codes are stricter, buildings are unlikely to collapse. If you are outside, fixtures, window glass, and bricks falling off of buildings are a greater threat.

Statistically, you are still safer inside even if you are in areas where building codes are inadequate. Most buildings do not collapse. If you are outside, you are in as much danger from rubble falling from a nearby building that does collapse.

There is no single rule that will guarantee your safety in a large earthquake. If you know your building is not sound, such as the ground floor of an unreinforced mud-brick building, you should try to get out. But know that when you are outside, nearby buildings and structures pose a great danger too.
