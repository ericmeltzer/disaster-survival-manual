# The Psychology of Survival

Understanding your own psychological responses to a disaster situation is the beginning of preparedness, and will also serve you well during stressful situations in daily life.

The techniques described in this section are strategies for dealing with the intense stressors of a disaster. With these techniques, you can be sure that you will not give up before the last of your physical strength is gone.

Specifically, these techniques will help you avoid two states:

**Panic**,  an uncontrolled response that occurs when you are overwhelmed by stress, fear, or anxiet and can make you suddenly want to run away, or clumsily rush to complete tasks that need to be done carefully, and **Resignation**, an emotional state that occurs when you lose your will to survive, which can result unexpectedly from too much frustration or stress.(1)(US Army Survival Manual ch 1)


##THINGS TO DO TO BEFORE DISASTER STRIKES

**INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO YOUR NEIGHBORS**

Knock on your neighbors doors and introduce yourself, if you haven't already. Bring cookies! Get to know them, and get their phone numbers. Besides the obvious benefits of having a good relationship with your neighbors, they will be the people who go through any disaster with you, and you shouldn't be meeting them for the first time in a disaster situation.

**TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF**

Being in good physical and mental shape will help you be ready for any disaster. Before people go on long nautical voyages, and before soldiers deploy, they take care of any nagging health issues (both physical and mental) to ensure that they're ready for anything. Since you don't have the advantage of knowing when disaster hits, please start taking care of yourself now. Get enough sleep (the exact amount varies, but knowing whether you're getting enough is pretty easy: if you're constantly tired, you aren't!) Exercise regularly, 30 minutes per day is a good minimum. Eat right.

**LEARN TO USE AND CONTROL STRESS**

In situations you cannot control, being able to control your own emotions is an invaluable skill, and one that can be honed with practice. Every stressful situation in your daily life is a free chance to practice reacting calmly to stressors. If you get cut off on the freeway, or if someone is rude to you, allow the stress you feel to slip away and not perturb your calm. This will get easier the more you do it.

There are also many disciplines that can enhance your control over your emotional state, including cognitive restructuring techniques, Eastern meditation, and Stoic philosophy (1)(US Army Survival Manual ch 1).

**PLAN**

Having a written plan in place for what you'll do in the event of a disaster is crucial; it allows you to mechanically execute the plan when disaster strikes instead of wasting precious time deciding what to do. **Extensive disaster planning materials and templates are provided here in Appendix I**

**HAVE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS**

Talk to people who have lived through natural disasters common to your area. Think about what it would be like to be in the situations they describe, and about what skills would help you cope with the stressors you'd be facing.

**HAVE A KIT**

Having a pre-packed survival kit makes a huge difference in your ability to sustain yourself in the absence of normal urban infrastructure. A list of what to include in a good survival pack is included in [Appendix II](). If you'd like to purchase our pre-packed kit, you can do so [here]().

**TRAIN**

Training ahead of time in first aid, survival skills, or search and rescue techniques will help you immensely when a disaster hits. A New Guinean proverb holds that "knowledge is only rumor until it is in the muscle" and it is true that knowledge which has been practiced is vastly more useful than book knowledge.

##HOW TO MINIMIZE STRESS DURING A DISASTER

**GET TO WORK**

The best way to reduce stress and anxiety is to simply do the routine tasks that ensure your survival (1)(US Army Survival Manual ch 1). Hydrate yourself, eat if you are hungry, assess any injuries you or other members of your group have, go over [checklists](), find shelter, and otherwise occupy yourself to reduce anxiety. If you have some downtime, play cards.

**BE CAUTIOUS**

In daily life its fun to push your physical limits, but in a survival situation you need to take every easy win you can get. If you're a little chilly, bundle up. If you have water, drink it. Small stressors can add up, so minimize the stress your body is under whenever you can. Stay in good condition so that when you really need to push yourself, you'll be able to.

**BE REALISTIC**

Deceiving yourself about the seriousness of an injury, the harshness of a weather pattern or the distance to a safe place can lead to disappointment and increased stress as reality encroaches.

**BE EXTREMELY STUBBORN**

Many people have died because they gave up just before help arrived. Understand that if it's time for you to die, you will be dead; if you aren't dead, it isn't time yet, and you MUST NOT GIVE UP until you breathe your last breath.


##HOW TO HELP OTHERS

**EMPATHETICALLY LISTEN**

Besides the practical questions, asking how someone is doing, where they came from, what they've been through etc are opportunities for the person to speak to someone about their experiences, an important part of debriefing and decompressing after a stressful situation.

There are right and wrong ways to listen, and several phrases (cite CERT manual) which should be avoided:

| Don't Say | Why not | Instead say |
| -- | -- | -- |
| "I understand" | Survivors may feel you can't possibly understand what they have been through | "I'm sorry" |
| "Don't feel bad" | It is normal to feel bad in the aftermath of a disaster | "It's normal to feel this way" |
| "It could be worse" | Not helpful in this situation | "I'm sorry" |
| "It's God's will" | Bringing up religion is unhelpful with someone you don't know, and this phrase can be extremely upsetting | "I'm sorry" |
| "Don't Cry" | It's normal to have an emotional response to trauma | You don't need to say anything to someone who is crying. |




**ENLIST OTHERS TO HELP**

In the same way that simply doing the routine tasks that ensure your survival will help you stay focused and not panicked, it will help others. If you encounter other survivors, get them eating, drinking, and assisting with whatever tasks need to be done. If someone seems distressed, even busywork is a very effective way to help them calm down, and in the aftermath of a disaster there is always something to be done. If nothing else, they can help clean up the area you are in, prepare food for others, or sort supplies.
