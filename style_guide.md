Style, content & sourcing guide

1. Citations where the source is online should look like this [(SAR Manual)](http://wikipedia.org) and if the source is printed material, like this: (McCarthy, 1991). We'll work up a bibliography when we're done but that's all thats required for now.

2. When in doubt, cite. If you want to quote from the source material if it's particularly well phrased on a topic, feel free to do so but keep the quotes short. Any giant block quotes should be rewritten in original language.

3. Prefer common words over uncommon ones, and simple language over jargon.

4. Refer to the sample chapter for formatting questions, headers, etc.

5. Favor speed over perfect phrasing. We’ll do a big editing pass, so it's better to write more than to worry about each sentence too much.

6. Only include actionable information, minimize background info that is interesting but isn't directly usable by people in a disaster situation.

7. Use the PDF's I sent you as sources, and go to Google for additional source material. For the sample chapter on disaster psychology I sent the first few google hits for "disaster psychology" were very useful CDC papers, for example.
