Contributing to this guide:

First, welcome! We're collectively writing and editing the world's best disaster survival resource, which will always be available for free and with a permissive license for people to remix and reuse as they see fit. 

We had a fair chunk of it written, and then we found out that one of our freelancers plagiaraized some stuff. Mega-bummer! Now we're re-writing.





Style, content & sourcing

1. **Only include actionable information, minimize background info that is interesting but isn't directly usable by people in a disaster situation.** This is the most important guideline. This book will be read by people in disaster situations and must value concision over all else.


2. The guide is primarily intended for people living in cities, so at least for now the stuff that other guides include about hunting for game etc can be left out. 

3. Citations where the source is online should look like this [(SAR Manual)](http://wikipedia.org/sarmanual) and if the source is printed material, like this: (McCarthy, 1991). We'll work up a bibliography when we're done but that's all that's required for now.

3. When in doubt, cite. If you want to quote from the source material if it's particularly well phrased on a topic, feel free to do so but keep the quotes short. Any giant block quotes should be rewritten in original language.

4. Prefer common words over uncommon ones, and simple language over jargon.

5. Refer to "Psychology of Survival" chapter for formatting questions, headers, etc.

6. Favor speed over perfect phrasing. Weâ€™ll be repeatedly editing as we go, so it's better to write more than to worry about each sentence too much.

7. Use the PDF's I sent you as sources, and go to Google for additional source material. For the sample chapter on disaster psychology I sent the first few google hits for "disaster psychology" were very useful CDC papers, for example.
