# First Aid

In a disaster situation, the most important thing you can do is to get help moving to the area. Pick an uninjured bystander and order them loudly and cleary, "YOU, call 911 and tell me when you're done."

## Triage

If you are uninjured, the first step will be determining the degree of injury to others affected by the incident. In any case of multiple casualties, some will recover if you do nothing, some will die if everything possible is done, others will recover only if the correct things are done quickly. The goal of triage is to identify that third group so that the resources available can be directed to aid them.
