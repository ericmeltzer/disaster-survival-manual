# First Aid

In a disaster situation, the most important thing you can do is to get help moving to the area. Pick an uninjured bystander and order them loudly and clearly, "**YOU**, call 911 and tell me when you're done."

With professional help on the way, your next task is to assess where that help will be best applied.


## Triage

If you are reading this manual, we're assuming you're uninjured, so your first step will be determining the degree of injury to others affected by the incident. 

In any case of multiple casualties, some will recover if you do nothing, some will die if everything possible is done, others will recover only if the correct things are done quickly. The goal of triage is to clearly identify the groups so that the resources on the way can be directed to aid them appropriately.

1. Look around and pick an easily identifiable area that is safe from immediate danger.
2. Loudly and clearly announce, "Listen! If you can move, go to [name and description of safe area]." 

Anyone that can do this is no longer your concern. If they have injuries, they can be treated later. They can also be called on to assist with later steps if needed.

Now, **only if it is safe to do so**, enter the area with additional casualties and do a quick evaluation. You want to spend about 30 seconds per person.

1. Is the person breathing?
