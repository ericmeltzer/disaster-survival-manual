# First Aid

In a disaster situation, the most important thing you can do is to get help moving to the area. Pick an uninjured bystander and order them loudly and clearly, "**YOU**, call 911 and tell me when you're done."

With professional help on the way, your next task is to assess where that help will be best applied. If more than one person is injured, you need a system for determining how to do that.


## Triage

[[Query: Will the kit have standard, multi-color triage tags? If not, references to "[color] tag" below will be modified to sharpie marks on forehead.]]

If you are reading this manual, we're assuming you're uninjured, so your first step will be determining the degree of injury to others affected by the incident. 

In any case of multiple casualties, some will recover if you do nothing, some will die if everything possible is done, others will recover only if the correct things are done quickly. The goal of triage is to clearly identify the groups so that the resources on the way can be directed to aid them appropriately.

1. Look around and pick an easily identifiable area that is safe from immediate danger.
2. Loudly and clearly announce, "Listen! If you can move, go to [name and description of safe area]." 

Anyone that can do this is no longer your immediate concern. If they have injuries, they can be treated later. They can also be called on to assist with treating others if needed.

Now, **only if it is safe to do so**, enter the area with additional casualties and do a quick evaluation. You want to spend about 30 seconds per person.

1. Is the person breathing? If yes, go to step 3.
2. If the person is not breathing, clear their airway. (Remove blocking material, manually thrust their jaw forward, tilt head if no danger of neck injury.) Are they breathing now?  If yes, Red tag. If no, Black tag. Move on.
3. Is the person breathing more than 5 times in 10 seconds? If yes, Red tag, move on. If no, go to step 4.
4. Squeeze the person's fingernail until the nailbed blanches of color. Release and count how long it takes to return to color. If more than 2 seconds, Red tag, move on. If less, go to step 5.
5. Ask the person their name and what happened. If they do not reply or reply inappropriately, Red tag, move on. If they answer appropriately, Yellow tag, move on.

This is all you are doing on your first pass. When you have assessed all the patients, you can return to assist those that need it most. (Those with Red tags.) Right now, your priority is to find everyone that needs help.

If you notice a person is bleeding profusely or is showing signs of shock (pale, or rapid breathing), direct a bystander or someone that previously moved out of the area to provide appropriate treatment. (For bleeding, direct pressure. For shock, keep the person warm and elevate their feed.) Do not provide this treatment yourself, you have more important things to do.

If you enter a building, draw a diagonal line on the wall next to the door you entered. After you have thoroughly searched the building and exited again (**and not before**) draw a second line on the wall to make an X. Next to the X, write the date and the number of patients found inside.

When help arrives, go to the senior person and tell them what you know.
