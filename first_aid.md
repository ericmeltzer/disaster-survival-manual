#Disaster Medicine: Protecting Health and Saving Lives

One of the most critical aspects of managing a disaster is dealing with the injuries and health concerns that arise in these situations. By learning to administer basic first aid, you can be a valuable asset to your family and your neighbors in the event of an emergency. Learning these skills in advance will help you to keep your cool and administer life-saving first aid when it is needed the most. 
These techniques can preserve a personís life until they are able to see a doctor. Of the people who will die during an emergency situation, many of them will die within the first 3 to 30 minutes, which is often faster than medical support can arrive on the scene. By administering emergency first aid, these simple first aid actions could give the injured person a better chance to survive.

##Preparing a First Aid Kit
It is important to take the time to assemble your first aid kit, to ensure that all of the supplies are available that you might need to administer first aid. These are some of the items the kit should contain:
-Latex gloves
-Sterile bandages and gauze pads in various sizes
-Medical adhesive tape
-Sterile roller bandages, both 2-inch and 3-inch
-Antiseptic
-Scissors
-Tweezers
-Needle and assorted safety pins
-Thermometer
-Petroleum jelly
-Soap, or another cleansing agent
-Sunscreen
-Commonly used medications, including pain reliever, antacid, anti-diarrheal, Ipecac syrup, activated charcoal, and laxatives

Make sure that your first aid kit is prepared in advance, and have it easily accessible so that you can quickly reach the supplies when they are needed. It is a good idea to assemble multiple first aid kits so that you can keep them in various locations: at home, in the car, at the office, and anywhere else that you spend a lot of time. You never know when you will need these supplies, so it is beneficial to have them on hand.

##Top Priority: Protect Yourself
The most important thing that you can do when you are administering first aid is to make sure that you are protecting your own health. If you injure yourself, you wonít be in a position to help the other person in need. Additionally, certain diseases can be transmitted through body fluids, causing you to suffer from the effects of that disease for the rest of your life.
Take precautionary measures to keep body fluids and blood off yourself when you are caring for another person. Always use latex gloves when they are available, and other types of protective clothing such as glasses or a covering over your clothing. If you donít have latex gloves, try covering your hands with plastic bags instead. It is best to keep a layer between your skin and the person that you are touching.
Frequently wash your hands to prevent the spread of germs. If you get blood in your eyes or an open wound on your own body, then you should flush it as soon as possible to prevent infection.

##Emergency First Aid vs. Medical Care
Unless you are a doctor or medical professional, you need to use caution to provide only first aid treatments. The goal of the treatment is to stabilize the injured person and preserve their life until you can get them to a medical professional. 
While administering first aid, you can check the person for injuries in order to provide as much information as possible to the emergency medical providers. You wonít be able to make a diagnosis, but you can provide observations such as ìtheir left hand is bleedingî or ìtheir right leg seems to be dislocated.î
When you approach the injured person, talk with them to let the person know that you are there to help. Explain that you are not a medical doctor, but you are going to provide first aid treatment to help with their injuries until they can meet with a doctor.

##Six Steps to Facing an Emergency Situation
There are six specific steps that should be followed when you are managing the first aid problems during a disaster situation. 
-1. First, calm yourself by taking a deep breath. Maintaining focus and a clear mind is critical during this time, because you will be in a better position to offer high quality care. Your calmness will help the injured person to calm down as well.
-2. Assess the situation. Look around to observe potentially dangerous situations so that you can decide if the person needs to be moved. For example, nearby fires, high amounts of traffic, or unstable buildings could cause more injury. If it is determined that the person needs to be moved, then use extreme caution if a spinal injury is suspected. Be careful to not move the neck or back.
-3. Treat the problems in sequential order, starting with breathing. You will need to determine the most dangerous problems first, and offer treatment for those things. Always check and treat breathing first, because it is an essential function to preserve their life. 
-4. Search for bleeding, and control the heavy bleeding by applying pressure on location. Heavy bleeding can cause death, so the bleeding should be controlled before moving onto other forms of first aid.
-5. Do a full-body search to look for broken bones or injuries. If you have determined that the person is breathing and the bleeding has been controlled, then you should check the full body for injured areas. Look over the area, and carefully touch everything to see if hidden injuries are present. Start at the top of the head, and work your way down every part of the body until you have reached their feet.
-6. Maintain a calm attitude and be gentle with the injured person. That person is likely scared and nervous about the situation, and they will react to the tone of your voice and the way you are interacting with them. Be gentle and comforting in your voice and movement.

##Questions to Ask an Injured Person
When you are assessing the injuries and administering first aid, there are several questions that you can ask to assess the injuries and get more information from the person. These questions will vary depending on the situation, but they might include things such as:
-ìWhat is your name?î or ìWhat year is it?î to assess the mental status of the person
-ìDo you feel pain in any specific location?î
-ìWhat happened?î
-ìHow are you feeling?î
-ìDo you feel any loss of sensation in your body?î

##Identifying the Cause of Breathing Problems
If a person is experiencing breathing problems, then you need to assess the situation and restore breathing as quickly as possible. There are several reasons why breathing might be obstructed:
-Neck or face injuries
-Unnatural position of the head that ìkinksî the neck
-Foreign object in the throat or mouth, such as a piece of food
-Tongue relaxing and blocking the airway when the person is unconscious and laying down
If possible, remove the obstruction of the airway or reposition the personís head and neck in order to open the airway to allow breathing.

##Treating Severe Bleeding
If a major blood vessel in the body has been injured, it can be extremely dangerous because the person can lose a lot of blood. When an injured person loses 1 liter of blood, it can result in symptoms of shock. Continued loss of blood, up to 2 liters, will increase the shock and puts extreme danger on the body. In most cases, the loss of 3 liters of blood is a fatal injury. In the situation of blood loss, a fast response is the best way to control the bleeding and protect the personís life. 
Make sure that you identify the source of blood loss, and then apply pressure directly on the area where the blood is flowing. You will need to get a good look at the injury, because it might be confusing to find the exact source of blood loss if the person is already covered in blood. So, find the exact source before applying the pressure.
It is always best to use gauze to stop the bleeding when possible, but in serious cases of blood loss you might not have the opportunity to get the gauze before applying pressure. Look for any clothing or other type of fabric that might be used, and place the fabric directly over the area and then apply firm pressure with your hand.

##Watch for Symptoms of Dehydration
In disaster situations, it is common for a person to suffer from dehydration. Certain activities such as cold exposure, heat exposure, intense activity, burns, illness, or high altitude might cause the body to lose water more quickly.
Severe shock is more likely in injured people, and you should watch for signs of dehydration and keep the person hydrated if possible. Potential signs of dehydration include:
-Low urine output
-Dark colored urine with a strong odor 
-Fatigue
-Decrease in skin elasticity
-Sunken, dark eyes
-Emotional instability
-Delayed capillary refill in fingernail beds
In a survival situation, it is difficult to make up for a deficit of water. So, it is best to replace the water as quickly as possible. Most people can only drink 1 liter of water at a time, so you should focus on providing small amounts of water at consistent intervals.
Keep the injured person hydrated, and you should also stay hydrated while you are caring for them. Mental and physical stress requires higher water intake.
