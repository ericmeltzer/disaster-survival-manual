# First Aid

In a disaster situation, the most important thing you can do is to get help moving to the area. Pick an uninjured bystander and order them loudly and clearly, "**YOU**, call 911 and tell me when you're done."

With professional help on the way, your next task is to assess where that help will be best applied. If more than one person is injured, you need a system for determining how to do that.


## Priorities

First and foremost, make sure you are safe and uninjured. Just like they tell you during the airline safety briefing, "Secure you own mask before helping others." If you injure yourself while attempting to help another there are now two casualties and one less person to help. So you have made the chances of the person you were trying to help worse and have endangered yourself in the process. Don't do that.


## Triage

In any case of multiple casualties, some will recover if you do nothing, some will die if everything possible is done, others will recover only if the correct things are done quickly. The goal of triage is to clearly identify the groups so that the resources on the way can be directed to aid them appropriately.

1. Look around and pick an easily identifiable area that is safe from immediate danger.
2. Loudly and clearly announce, "Listen! If you can move, go to [name and description of safe area]."

Anyone that can do this is no longer your immediate concern. If they have injuries, they can be treated later. They can also be called on to assist with treating others if needed.

Now, **only if it is safe to do so**, enter the area with additional casualties and do a quick evaluation. You want to spend about 30 seconds per person.

1. Is the person breathing? If yes, go to step 3.
2. If the person is not breathing, clear their airway. (Remove blocking material, manually thrust their jaw forward, tilt head if no danger of neck injury.) Are they breathing now?  If yes, use a Sharpie to mark their forehead with Roman numeral I. If no, mark them with a zero. Move on.
3. Is the person breathing more than 5 times in 10 seconds? If yes, mark with Roman numeral I, move on. If no, go to step 4.
4. Squeeze the person's fingernail until the nailbed blanches of color. Release and count how long it takes to return to color. If more than 2 seconds, mark with Roman numeral I, move on. If less, go to step 5.
5. Ask the person their name and what happened. If they do not reply or reply inappropriately, mark with Roman numeral I, move on. If they answer appropriately, mark with Roman numeral II, move on.

This is all you are doing on your first pass. When you have assessed all the patients, you can return to assist those that need it most. (Those with Roman numeral I.) Right now, your priority is to find everyone that needs help.

If you notice a person is bleeding profusely or is showing signs of shock (pale, or rapid breathing), direct a bystander or someone that previously moved out of the area to provide appropriate treatment. (For bleeding, direct pressure. For shock, keep the person warm and elevate their feet.) Do not provide this treatment yourself, you have more important things to do.

If you enter a building during this process, draw a diagonal line on the wall next to the door you entered. After you have thoroughly searched the building and exited again (**and not before**) draw a second line on the wall to make an X. Next to the X, write the date and the number of patients found inside.

When help arrives, go to the senior person and tell them what you know.


## Aiding the injured

If you have completed triage, or if you are not dealing with multiple casualties, the next stage of first aid is to deal with the injuries presented. You have already done the **most important** thing you could do by getting help directed to the location. Survivability increases dramatically when help arrives.

Put on the nitrile gloves from your kit.

Now, approach the person you plan to assist. First, obtain permission to assist them. Say "Hi, my name is [your name]. Can I help you?"

If they answer in the affirmative, you may proceed. If they say nothing, their silence implies consent. If they say "No," and they are:

1. Not impaired by drugs or alcohol,
2. Of legal age, and
3. Aware that they are injured,

Back off until the help you're sent for arrives.

With permission secured the rest of your job follows the simple mnemonic, "A B C."

A. Airway
B. Breathing
C. Circulation

### Airway

If the person does not have a way for air to get to their lungs, they will die in four to six minutes.

The most common thing to block the airway is the person's tounge. Most people learn the head tilt method of opening an airway. This works, but risks additional damage in case of a neck injury. If you have any suspicion of a neck injury (car accident, fall, any injury above the collarbone) do a jaw thrust instead.

Kneel above the person's head, hold their head stable with the heels of your hands, push up on the angle of the jaw with your fingers, moving the chin up. This will lift the personâ€™s tongue out of his airway.

If you hear the gurgling of fluid or can see other material (teeth, mud, blood, vomit) that will block the airway, sweep any material out of the person's mouth with your (gloved) fingers. Turning the person on their side will let fluids drain out.

Once you've established an airway, you can move on to breathing.

### Breathing

With an airway established, look, listen, and feel for air going in and out of the person's lungs. Does their chest rise and fall? Can you hear air going in and out if you place your ear near their nose and mouth? Can you feel their chest rise and fall?

If they are not breathing, you will need to breath for them. Grab the CPR mask from your kit. Place the narrow end near the bridge of the person's nose and the wider end on their chin below their mouth, not under the chin. While using your hands to keep the airway open, press with your fingers to seal the mask to the person's face.

You want to give the person one breath every five seconds. The breath should be enough to see their chest rise. Don't blow too fast or too hard. You should be able to feel the air flowing into the person's chest. If not, check for airway again. Lack of an airway or blowing too fast or hard can result in air in the stomach which may lead to the person vomiting.

You don't begin checking for breathing until you've established an airway and you don't move on to checking circulation until you've taken care of breathing. So if you are doing the breathing for the person, you continue doing it until they are breathing on their own or you get assistance.

### Circulation

First step of Circulation is checking for a heartbeat. If the person's heart isn't beating you're doing full CPR. Give hard compressions to the chest at a rate of about 15 every 10 seconds. You want to compress one and a half to two inches. Professionals giving chest compressions will frequently break ribs. That isn't your goal, but gives you an idea of how hard you need to press.

If the person's heart is beating, you can check for other problems with circulation. The most obvious is blood leaving the body. The treatment for this is simple: put the heel of your hand against the bleeding spot and press. Hard. Take a bandage or the cleanest cloth you can find and press it to the bleeding spot. If it soaks through, add another and press. Keep adding and pressing until the bleeding stops.

If that doesn't work, try elevating the bleeding area above the person's heart while pressing. (This naturally won't be possible for all injuries.)

If pressure and elevation are not stopping the bleeding, try to find a pressure point between the wound and the heart. Any place on the body where an artery passes over a bone and you can feel a pulse is a pressure point. Press hard to stop the flow of blood.

Tourniquets are a last resort. Using a tourniquet is essentially condemning the person to amputation at some point. If you must use a tourniquet, get the tactical tourniquet from your kit. Find a place between the heart and the wound to place it. You want something over solid bone (not on a joint or fracture). [[ Insert instructions for applying the tactical tourniquet. ]]

When the tourniquet is in place, mark the time on the label area. Do not cover the tourniquet with additional bandages, blankets, or a coat. Emergency responders will need to know that a tourniquet has been applied and when it was applied.

### Repeat A B C

Once you've established an airway for the injured person, they are breathing, and their blood is circulating, you have covered the large portion of things that will cause them to die in short order. Re-check these things every five minutes. Remember, a person can live without an airway for only four to six minutes. If you don't know what to do next for the person you are treating, re-check your A B C.

#### Special Cases: Sucking Chest Wound

A mix of a Breathing and Circulation problem, this is a wound that penetrates the chest cavity. So we have bleeding from the wound itself and the fact that air is going in and out of the wound, not into the lungs where it belongs.

Treatment of these is straight-forward: apply an occulsive dressing. There is one included in your kit, just apply sticky-side down. If you've used this previously or don't have your kit, get creative. The goal is to get an air-tight seal so that breathing gets air into the lungs through the airway that you've established. Examples of improvised occlusive dressings (usually combined with tape for the edges):

* plastic wrap,
* credit cards,
* candy wrappers,
* petroleum jelly on gauze,
* playing cards.

Once the wound is sealed, continue to check the person's breathing. If they have increased trouble breathing, air may be building up pressure in the chest cavity, collapsing the lung. This could be caused by an injury to the lung itself or from a hole you haven't found yet. In any case, the treatment is to equalize the pressure by unsealing the bandage, "burping" the wound by applying pressure to the chest to force the air out, and re-sealing.
