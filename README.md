#Preface

This is a manual, not a novel. It contains the information you need to survive a natural disaster, and help your family and community members do the same. You don't need to read it front-to-back. Read the parts that look useful, and feel free to skip around. 

Although the emergency response bureaucracies of modern states are among the largest and best-equipped in history, in some ways we've never been more vulnerable as individuals to the damage done by disasters. We've outsourced our own survival skills to trained professionals, and have become highly reliant on centralized organizations as our community ties have become weaker and weaker.

In a sufficiently large disaster, it can take 3 days or more for official emergency response organizations to arrive. Even once they have arrived, their impact is not always purely positive. After the 1906 earthquake a confused and out of control National Guard battalion killed hundreds of San Franciscans, and in more recent memory the criminal conduct of emergency responders in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina made an already awful situation worse in New Orleans.

Even if the official emergency response effort is both speedy and compassionate, your food, water, medical aid and shelter needs are your own responsibility for at least 72 hours. This manual will be your guide through that critical period.
